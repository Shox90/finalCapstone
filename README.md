The project name: Shoe Inventory
This is a Python program that manages a list of shoes objects. It provides several functionalities:
Reading data from a file 'inventory.txt' to initialise the list of shoes objects.
Capturing new shoes data from user input and appending to the shoes list.
Printing the details of all shoes objects in a tabulated format.
Finding the shoe object with the lowest quantity and asking the user if they want to add more quantity to this shoe.
You need to install the tabulate module for the view_all() function to work properly.
You can choose an IDE (i.e. Pycharm, VS Code) or from the command line to run the code
